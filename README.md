**Background**  
Economic input-output models include all monetary transactions between industry sectors. They identify what goods and services (output) are consumed by other industries (input). These mathematical models can be transformed into production networks.

**Objective**  
Our study’s aim is to examine how sectors support each other in growth by modelling production networks developed from input-output models. The study’s research questions include whether the production networks have a defined topology, whether it changes in time, and which top industries stay the same.

**Methodology**  
For data sources, we use the newest US Input-Output Accounts Data from 2007 and 2012. We develop and explore the detail-level network of four hundred sectors. We examine their topology and centrality metrics under various thresholds for what represents a supporting link between two industries.

**Results**  
We find that the production network is highly sensitive to a defined threshold and that the field of sectors is asymmetric.
